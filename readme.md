## Installation

Install from the Python package index:

`pip install lily-unit-test`


## Basic usage

Create a file: `my_class.py`

```python
"""
This example shows how to run a simple unit test.
"""
  
import lily_unit_test
  
  
class MyClass(object):
    """
    Your class that will do something amazing.
    """
  
    @staticmethod
    def add_one(x):
        return x + 1
  
    @staticmethod
    def add_two(x):
        return x + 2
  
  
class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    """
    The test suite for testing MyClass.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def test_add_one():
        assert MyClass.add_one(3) == 4, 'Wrong return value'

    @staticmethod
    def test_add_two():
        assert MyClass.add_two(3) == 5, 'Wrong return value'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    """
    Run the test code, when not imported.
    """

    MyTestSuite().run()
```

Run the file: `python -m my_class.py`

The output should look like:

```
2023-12-20 19:28:46.105 | INFO   | Run test suite: MyTestSuite
2023-12-20 19:28:46.105 | INFO   | Run test case: MyTestSuite.test_add_one
2023-12-20 19:28:46.106 | INFO   | Test case MyTestSuite.test_add_one: PASSED
2023-12-20 19:28:46.106 | INFO   | Run test case: MyTestSuite.test_add_two
2023-12-20 19:28:46.106 | INFO   | Test case MyTestSuite.test_add_two: PASSED
2023-12-20 19:28:46.106 | INFO   | Test suite MyTestSuite: 2 of 2 test cases passed (100.0%)
2023-12-20 19:28:46.106 | INFO   | Test suite MyTestSuite: PASSED
```

You can run multiple tests by running the test runner.
The test runner is an object that runs test suites from a specific folder recursively.

```python
from lily_unit_test import TestRunner

TestRunner.run('path/to/test_suites')
```

The test runner will create a folder with reports about the tests that were executed.
More details of the test runner are explained further in this document. 


## Object definitions

In the sections below, the following objects are described:

* [Test suite class](#test-suite-class)
* [Test runner](#test-runner-object)

***

## Test suite class

The test suite class is a base class that is used for all the test suites.
Test cases are created by adding test methods to the test suite.
These test methods are executed by the test suite run method.
Preceding the test cases, an optional setup method is executed.
If the setup fails, execution is stopped.
Following the test cases a teardown method will be executed,
regardless whether the test cases passed or failed.

### Test suite creation

Creating a test suite is a simple as creating a subclass:

```python
import lily_unit_test

class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    ...
```

Test cases are added using methods with the prefix: `test_`:

```python
import lily_unit_test

class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    
    def test_login(self):
        ...
    
    def test_upload_image(self):
        ...
```

In this case two test cases are defined.
The tests are executed in the order as they are created, from top to bottom.

### Running the test suite

The test suite can be run using the `run` method.
The `run` method returns `True` if the test suite passed and `False` if failed.
In order to make the test suite run properly, the test suite must be initialized:

```python
# Initialize test suite, the test suite does not have any parameters
ts = MyTestSuite()
# Run the test suite
ts.run()
    
# A nice one liner
MyTestSuite().run()

# Using the test result
if MyTestSuite().run():
    print('Yay, the test suite passed!')
else:
    print('Oops, the test suite failed...')
```

### Using setup and teardown

The test suite has a default setup and teardown that can be overridden in the subclass.
The default setup and teardown do nothing, they are just empty methods.
If not overridden, it will not matter.
The setup and teardown can be overridden in your test suite:

```python
import lily_unit_test

class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    
    connection = None
    
    def setup(self):
        self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    
    def test_upload_image(self):
        self.connection.upload_image(filename)
    
    def test_download_image(self):
        self.connection.download_image(uri, filename)
    
    def teardown(self):
        # In case the connection could not be created, the connection propery could still be None
        if self.connection is not None and self.connection.is_connected():
            self.connection.close()
```

In this hypothetical example, prior to all tests a connection to a server is created.
In case this fails because of an exception, the execution stops and the test suite fails.
In case the setup passes, the test cases will be executed.
Finally, the teardown is executed. The teardown closes the connection with the server.
If in the hypothetical case, the connection was not established in the setup (failed for some reason),
closing a not established connection can cause an exception.
The test suite will fail if the teardown fails because of an exception.


### Making test suites pass or fail

A test case method or setup method is passed by the following conditions:

* There were no exceptions or asserts.
* The return value is None or True.

A test case method or setup method is failed by the following conditions:

* An exception or assert was raised
* The return value is False

The teardown can only fail if an exception or assert was raised. The return value is not used.

### Examples of passing or failing test suites

The following examples only show the specific test method from the test suite.

```python
def test_login(self):
    # Setup that fails by exception from the connect to server method
    self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    # The return value is by default None

def test_login(self):
    self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    # Fail by raising an exception
    if not self.connection.is_connected():
        raise Exception('We are not connected')
    # The return value is by default None

def test_login(self):
    self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    # Fail by assert
    assert self.connection.is_connected(), 'We are not connected'
    # The return value is by default None

def test_login(self):
    self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    # Pass or fail by return True or False
    return self.connection.is_connected()
```

### Logging messages

The test suite has a build in logger for logging messages.
Log messages are stored in an internal buffer (a list with strings)
and are directly written to the standard output (stdout, usually the console).
Messages from the standard output and error handler (stdout and stderr),
are redirected to the logger. When using `print()`, the output is stored in the logger.
If an exception is raised, the trace message from the exception is stored in the logger.
The logger can be accessed by the log attribute of the test suite:

```python
import lily_unit_test

class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    ...
    some test stuff here
    ...


# Initialize the test suite
ts = MyTestSuite()

# Access the logger
# Write a message to the internal buffer and it will also shown on the standard output
ts.log.info('Log an info level message')

print('This mesage will be written to the logger')

# Get a reference to the list with messages
messages = ts.log.get_log_messages()

# Get a copy of the list with messages
messages = ts.log.get_log_messages().copy()
```

Note that you do not need to run the test suite to use the logger.

The following methods can be used:

* **info( *message* ):**
  
  Log an information level message.<br />&nbsp;

* **debug( *message* ):**

  Log a debug level message.<br />&nbsp;

* **error( *message* ):**

  Log an error level message.<br />&nbsp;

* **empty_line( ):**

  Add an empty line to the log.<br />&nbsp;

* **get_log_messages():**

  Returns a *reference* to the list object with the log messages.<br />
  To get a copy of the list, use: `get_log_messages().copy()`.<br />&nbsp;

The following methods are used internally, and it is not advised to use them.

* **handle_message( *message_type*, *message_text* ):**
  
  Writes a message to the internal buffer and to standard output.
  This method is used by the `info`, `debug`, `error` and `empty_line` methods.
  The method has the following parameters:
  * message_type: identifies the message type. Can be one of the following constants:
    * log.TYPE_INFO: information level
    * log.TYPE_DEBUG: debug level
    * log.TYPE_ERROR: error level
    * log.TYPE_STDOUT: message from stdout (when print is used)
    * log.TYPE_STDERR: message from stderr (when an exception is raised)
    * log.TYPE_EMPTY_LINE: insert an empty line
  * message_text: a string containing the message (can be multi line)<br />&nbsp;

* **shutdown():**

  Shuts down the logger. This should be called when the logger is no longer needed.
  This is automatically called when the test suite is done testing.
  Even when this method is called, the log messages are still available in the buffer.

Below some examples of log messages.

```python
def test_login(self):
    # Info message
    self.log.info('Connect to server')
    self.connection = connect_to_server(user, password)
    
    # Debug message
    self.log.debug('Connection status: {}'.format(self.connection.is_connected())
    
    # Let's check the connection properties using print
    # These messages will be written automatically to the logger
    # This can be useful for a quick logging of some variables
    print('Server IP  :', self.connection.get_server_ip())
    print('Server name:', self.connection.get_server_name())
    
    # Insert an empty line
    self.log.empty_line()
    
    if not self.connection.is_connected()
        # Error message
        self.log.error('We are not connected')
        
    return self.connection.is_connected()
```

Note that logging an error message NOT automatically makes the test fail.

### Classification

The test suite object has a build in classification.
This can be set by the `CLASSIFICATION` attribute.

```python
import lily_unit_test

class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    
    CLASSIFICATION = <value>
```

The values are defined in an object called `Classification` and can be imported from the package.

```python
import lily_unit_test

# Regular test suite
class MyTestSuite01(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    
    # By default the value is PASS, so this is not necessary 
    CLASSIFICATION = lily_unit_test.Classification.PASS


# Test suite that we expect to fail
class MyTestSuite02(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
    
    # Override the default value
    CLASSIFICATION = lily_unit_test.Classification.FAIL
```

The default value is `PASS`, and is usually suitable for most test suites.
This means in general there is no need to override this attribute.
Setting this attribute to `FAIL` will make the test suite pass in case of a failure.
All errors are logged as usual but the end result will be passed in case of a failure.
If the test suite passes, the test suite is marked as failed.

This situation is useful when the test fails because of a known issue,
and you want to accept the known issue. As long as the issue is there the test will pass.
When the issue is solved, the test fails, reminding you to restore the classification attribute.

The log messages will show this:

```
- No classification defined:
2024-01-05 19:35:54.328 | ERROR  | Test classification is not defined: None
2024-01-05 19:35:54.328 | ERROR  | Test suite TestSuiteClassification: FAILED

- Classification set to FAIL and test suite fails because of a known issue, but is accepted
2024-01-05 19:38:17.989 | INFO   | Test suite failed, but accepted because classification is set to FAIL
2024-01-05 19:38:17.989 | INFO   | Test suite TestSuiteClassification: PASSED

- Classification set to FAIL and test suite passes because of the known issue is solved
2024-01-05 19:39:46.530 | ERROR  | Test suite passed, but a failure was expected because classification is set to FAIL
2024-01-05 19:39:46.530 | ERROR  | Test suite TestSuiteClassification: FAILED
```

### Test methods

The test suite has some test methods that might be useful to use.

* **run( *log_traceback=False* ):**
  
  Runs the test suite. The test suite is run as follows:
  * First, the setup method is run. If the setup fails, the test suite stops running.
  * Second, all test methods are run (methods starting with `test_`).
  * Finally, the teardown is run.
  
  In case of an exception, extra traceback information can be logged by setting the `log_traceback` parameter to True.

* **fail( *error_message*, *raise_exception=True* ):**
  
  Logs an error message and raises an exception. By default, an exception is raised.
  When the exception is raised, the test suite stops and is reported as failed.

  Setting the `raise_exception` to False, does not raise an exception and the test suite continues.
  The fail method always returns `False`.

  ```python
  class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
  
        def test_something(self):
            ...
            do somethings
            ...
            
            result = passed
            if not check_if_someting_is_ok:
                # Log a failure without exception
                result = self.fail('Someting is not OK', False)
            
            ...
            do some other stuff
            ...
            
            # return whether we passed or failed
            return result
  ```

* **fail_if( *expression*, *error_message*, *raise_exception=True* ):**
  
  If the expression evaluates to `True`, an error message is logged and exception is raised by default.
  When the exception is raised, the test suite stops and is reported as failed.

  Setting the `raise_exception` to False, does not raise an exception and the test suite continues.
  The fail_if method returns `False` if the expression is `True`.
  
  ```python
  class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite):
  
        def test_something(self):
            self.fail_if(my_string == 'Is this OK?', 'The string is not OK')
            
            # Result will be False if the expressing is True, meaning a failure
            result = self.fail_if(my_string == 'Is this OK?', 'The string is not OK', False)
            
            # return whether we passed or failed
            return result
  ```

## Test runner object

The test runner collects and runs a number of test suites and
writes all the results to report files.

### Run the test runner

Running the test runner is a simple as:

```python
from lily_unit_test import TestRunner

TestRunner.run('path/to/test_suites')
```

### Collecting and running test suites

Test suites are recursively collected from the Python files in the given folder.
Given the following project structure:

```
project_files
  |- src
  |   |- folder_01
  |   |   |- module_01.py
  |   |   |- module_02.py
  |   |
  |   |- folder_02
  |       |- module_03.py
  |       |- module_04.py
  |
  |- test
      |- test_runner.py
```

The test_runner.py contains the following code:

```python
from lily_unit_test import TestRunner

TestRunner.run('../src')
```    

The test runner is located in the `./test` folder.
The test runner will run all tests in the folder: `../src`.
This is relative to the `test` folder. Be sure to run the test runner from the `test`folder.
You can also use an absolute path to the folder.

The test runner will scan all modules in the folder in `src` recursively.
This means all 4 python modules are checked for test suites.

The test runner imports each module and checks if the module contains a class that is
based on the test suite base class (`class MyTestSuite(lily_unit_test.TestSuite)`).

All test suites are executed in alphabetical order.
If a specific order is required, use numbers in the file and folder names to sort them.
The test runner will run all the test suites and will write report files to a folder.
The output folder will look like this:

```
project_files
 |- src
 |- tests
 |- lily_unit_test_reports              // generic report folder
     |- 20231220_143717                 // date and time of the test run
         |- 1_TestRunner.txt            // test runner log
         |- 2_Folder01Module01.txt      // test suite log
         |- 3_Folder01Module02.txt      // test suite log
         |- 4_Folder02Module03.txt      // test suite log
         |- 5_Folder02Module04.txt      // test suite log
```

These log files contain all messages from the test suite loggers.

### Test runner options

The test runner has the following options.

```python
from lily_unit_test import TestRunner

options = {
    # Set the folder where the report is written to
    'report_folder': 'path/to/reports',

    # Creates a single HTML file with all the results
    # See example in: examples/example_report.html
    'create_html_report': True,
            
    # Open the HTML report in the default browser 
    'open_in_browser': True,
    
    # Do not write log files, in case using the HTML report or other logging facilities
    'no_log_files': True,

    # Run only the test suites in this list, skip others
    # If the list is empty or omitted, all test suites are run
    'include_test_suites': [
        'TestSuite01',
        'TestSuite02'
    ],

    # Skip test suites in this list
    'exclude_test_suites': [
        'TestSuite03',
        'TestSuite04'
    ]
}

TestRunner.run('../src', options)
```

Because the options are in a dictionary, they can be easily read from a JSON file.

```python
import json
from lily_unit_test import TestRunner

TestRunner.run('../src', json.load(open('/path/to/json_file', 'r')))
```

This makes it easy to automate tests using different configurations.
